# Neuro-Symbolic AI Project

This repository demonstrates a Neuro-Symbolic AI system that integrates neural network learning with symbolic reasoning to achieve efficient and interpretable decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Efficient handling of image datasets using OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL.
- **Model Training**: Combines symbolic reasoning with neural networks for enhanced performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices for comprehensive analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generates insightful visual representations of data distributions and model results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuro-symbolic-ai.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd neuro-symbolic-ai
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
